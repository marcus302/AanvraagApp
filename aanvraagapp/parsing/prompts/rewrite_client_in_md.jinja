Extract from the HTML human readable text related to this client or company into pleasant to read markdown, including links, headers, etc, in the markdown. Disregard headers, footers, navigation, copyright notices, etc. Do as little summarization and keep the text as true to the original on the web page as possible. Reply with only the generated markdown and nothing else. As an exception to the instruction to remove navigational elements, do put the links into the markdown that refer to other pages on the same domain that could possibly contain interesting information about this client or company, such as employees, use cases, product descriptions, etc.

The HTML of the web page is:

{{html_content | safe}}
